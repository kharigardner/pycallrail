# CallRail API for Python

---------------------------

## Overview

I created this library to make it easier to integrate the CallRail API into Python applications. It is a wrapper around the CallRail API, which is documented [here](https://apidocs.callrail.com/).

## Installation

To install the library, run:

```bash
pip install pycallrail
```
